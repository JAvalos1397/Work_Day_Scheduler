Lesson 5
Workday Scheduler 
<br>
Here I have made a 24hr day scheduler! This will allow you to create and save plans you have for the rest of the day. 
But most importantly will help you keep up with your day by indicating what your current time is via change of color. 
Green means future > Red means Now > and Gray means past.
